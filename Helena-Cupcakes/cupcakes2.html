				<h2>Your assignment: Convert this site</h2>
                    <p>Here is the real-world scenerio: You are approached by local business <em><strong>The Helena Cupcake Shop</strong></em> to redesign your site. The company REALLY likes the look of it and want
                        to keep the same look and feel, but the owner read an article that your
                        website should not be designed in tables and that it should "shrink" so that you can read it on "phones and stuff". He approaches you to help
                        update the code on his website.</p>
                    <p>So now, you need to convert this site (actually, just this one page) from an old table-based layout into a new <em>HTML5 element</em> based layout with responsive design, complete with updated CSS. Here's what I should see:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>No tables ANYWHERE:</strong> There should be no table in your new code... only HTML 5 and div block elements to separate content.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lists:</strong> The menus at the <strong>top</strong>, <strong>right</strong>, and in the <strong>footer</strong> need to be converted into unordered lists.</li>
                        <li><strong>Goodbye align and bgcolor:</strong> If I see the word "align" or "bgcolor" anywhere in your HTML, your grade will get marked down.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strong CSS:</strong> You should have an external style sheet with classes and ids as attributes in your HTML - do not use inline or the internal &lt;style&gt; methods of CSS.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Keep the same look and feel,
                            but maybe you want to "refresh" the site a bit. I know the site seems a
                            little dated, but you don't want to tick off the owner by deviating too
                            far from the original design. Be creative, but smart and savvy.</li>
                        <li><b>Mobile-friendly:</b> Put a premium of resizing the design down for phone. Use percentages or media queries on your structure!<br>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Please submit your final design as a URL so I can see your finished work. Please be sure to activate the link so I can click on it.</p>

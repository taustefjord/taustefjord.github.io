<h1><a href="https://alaska.gov/">1. Alaska</a></h1>
<p>I like how Alaska shrinks down when you change how big the screen is.  That way it will be easily viewable from mobile devices.  I like how Alaska has the picture of a mountain that is segmented into three sections and when you go over it that section of the mountain turns into helpful links for you to explore.  I like how the website is organized into little categories.  Plus, I like the portion on the side which shows the next few days and what is going on during those days.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.nebraska.gov/">2. Nebraska</a></h2>
<p>I like how Nebraska shrinks down when you change how big the screen is.  That way it will be easily viewable from mobile devices.  I like the chart that is a little further down which tells you the amount of its appropriations and what they have been divvied up into.  I like how simple the website looks when you first open it up.  I don’t like how when you click on one of the circle links it doesn’t open it up in a different tab.</p>
<h3><a href="https://az.gov/">3. Arizona</a></h3>
<p>I like how Arizona shrinks down when you change how big the screen is.  That way it will be easily viewable from mobile devices.  I like how there is an orange tab that will go up when clicked on to reveal an interesting story of the background picture.  I like how the drop-down tabs drop down pictures with the rest of the information.  This is aesthetically pleasing and makes it easier for everyone to understand.</p>
<h4><a href="https://mt.gov/">4. Montana</a></h4>
<p>I like how Montana shrinks down when you change how big the screen is.  That way it will be easily viewable from mobile devices.  I like how there is pictures of the governor, senate and house representatives.  Plus, when you click on those pictures it takes you to their page.  I don’t like how all of the links are the same white color font.  At first, I thought that they were just text until I looked closer and moved my mouse over it.  This makes the website confusing and the links should be a different color.</p>
<h5><a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm">5. New Hampshire</a></h5>
<p>New Hampshire will shrink down a little but once it gets to a certain point it doesn’t.  This could make the website hard to use from a mobile device.  I like the picture of the river but I don’t like how the categories up top drop down over the picture.  Overall, this website looks bland and boring.  It does look official with the crest but overall it is still boring and I think it needs more pictures.</p>
